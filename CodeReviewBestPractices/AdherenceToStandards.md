# Adherence to Coding Standards

## Prompt 1: Reviewing Code for Standards
```
Intent: To guide developers in reviewing code for adherence to coding standards.

Context: You are reviewing a pull request for a new feature. The code details are as follows:

Code Snippet: {code_snippet}

Generate feedback on the code, ensuring:
- Proper naming conventions.
- Consistent indentation and formatting.
- Use of comments for clarity.

Example:
Code Snippet:
def addNumbers(a,b):
    return a+b
Feedback:
1. Rename the function to `add_numbers` to follow snake_case naming convention.
2. Add spaces around operators for better readability.
3. Include a docstring to describe the function's purpose.
