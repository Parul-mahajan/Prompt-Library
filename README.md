# Prompt Library

This repository contains reusable prompts for different personas and stages in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The prompts are organized to help streamline communication and tasks across various roles and phases of the SDLC.

## Personas
- **Developer**: Focused on coding, debugging, and implementing features.
- **Tester**: Responsible for quality assurance and testing.
- **Product Manager**: Oversees requirements and ensures alignment with business goals.
- **Designer**: Works on UI/UX and system design.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure.
- **Stakeholder**: Provides feedback and approves deliverables.

## SDLC Stages
1. **Requirements**: Gathering and analyzing requirements.
2. **Design**: Creating system architecture and design documents.
3. **Development**: Writing and reviewing code.
4. **Testing**: Performing unit, integration, and system testing.
5. **Deployment**: Releasing the product to production.
6. **Maintenance**: Handling updates, bug fixes, and support.
