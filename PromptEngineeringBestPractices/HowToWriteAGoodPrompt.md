# How to Write a Good Prompt

## Guidelines for Crafting Effective Prompts

1. **Be Clear and Specific**:
   - Clearly define the task or objective.
   - Avoid ambiguous language.

   Example:
   - Bad: "Write a function."
   - Good: "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion."

2. **Provide Context**:
   - Include relevant details to help the user or system understand the task.

   Example:
   - Bad: "Generate test cases."
   - Good: "Generate test cases for a login feature that includes username and password validation."

3. **Use Examples**:
   - Provide input-output examples to clarify expectations.

   Example:
   - Input: "5"
   - Output: "120"

4. **Be Concise**:
   - Avoid unnecessary details while ensuring completeness.

   Example:
   - Bad: "Write a function that does something with numbers."
   - Good: "Write a function to find the sum of an array of integers."

5. **Iterate and Refine**:
   - Test the prompt and refine it based on the results.
