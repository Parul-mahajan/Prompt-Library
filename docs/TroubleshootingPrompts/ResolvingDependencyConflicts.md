# Resolving Dependency Conflicts

## Prompt 1: Resolving Package Dependency Issues
```
Use Case: To help developers resolve conflicts between package dependencies.

Prompt: You are encountering dependency conflicts in a project. The project details are as follows:

Project_name: {project_name}
Dependency_error: {dependency_error}

Generate a step-by-step plan to resolve the dependency conflicts, including:
- Analyzing the dependency tree.
- Identifying conflicting versions.
- Suggesting resolution strategies.

Example:
Project_name: "Web Application"
Dependency_error: "Conflicting requirements for 'requests': app requires 2.25.0, but another package requires <2.24.0"
Plan:
1. Run a dependency resolver to visualize the dependency tree.
2. Identify which package is requiring the older version of 'requests'.
3. Check if the package can be updated to support newer versions.
4. Consider using virtual environments or dependency isolation techniques.
