# GitHub Copilot Chat Interaction Patterns

## Effective Question Patterns

### 1. Code Understanding
```markdown
/explain
What does this code do? Focus on:
- Main functionality
- Key algorithms
- Data flow
- Error handling
```

### 2. Problem Solving
```markdown
I'm trying to [goal]. My current approach is:
[code or description]

The issue I'm facing is:
[problem description]

What's the best way to solve this?
```

### 3. Code Review
```markdown
/analyze
Review this code for:
- Potential bugs
- Performance issues
- Security concerns
- Style violations
```

## Chat Commands

### 1. Code Generation
```markdown
