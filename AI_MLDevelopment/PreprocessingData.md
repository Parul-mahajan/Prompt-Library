# Basic Data Preprocessing with GitHub Copilot

## Prompt 1: Simple Data Preprocessing Steps
```
Use case: Help data scientists and ML engineers create preprocessing code for machine learning models.

Prompt: Preprocess a dataset for a machine learning model. The dataset details are:

dataset_type: {dataset_type}
target_variable: {target_variable}
basic_issues: {basic_issues}

Generate a preprocessing script that includes:
- Loading data.
- Basic cleaning.
- Feature transformations.
- Standard preprocessing steps.
`

Key points:
1. Use standard libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
2. Focus on common preprocessing steps.
3. Include basic data exploration.
4. Use standard approaches for handling missing values and outliers.
