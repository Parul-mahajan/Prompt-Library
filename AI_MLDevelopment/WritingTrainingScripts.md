# Writing Training Scripts for GitHub Copilot

## Prompt 1: Creating Basic Model Training Structure
```
Use case: Help developers create training scripts for machine learning models.

Prompt: Develop a training script for a basic machine learning model. The model details are:

model_type: {model_type}
dataset_description: {dataset_description}
training_objective: {training_objective}

Generate a training script structure that includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Model definition with standard architecture.
- Training loop with evaluation.


Key points:
1. Use simple architecture and standard components.
2. Focus on basic pipeline components: data loading, model definition, training loop, evaluation.
3. Use standard libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
4. Avoid complex custom implementations.`
