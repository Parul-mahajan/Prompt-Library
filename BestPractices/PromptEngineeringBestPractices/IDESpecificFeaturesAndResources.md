## Best Practices for Using GitHub Copilot

### Prompt Engineering

1. **Be Specific in Comments**
   - Write clear, detailed comments that describe what you want
   - Include expected inputs, outputs, and edge cases
   - Provide context and constraints when needed

2. **Use the Right Format**
   - Structure comments in a way that guides Copilot
   - Start with function signatures or type definitions
   - Include examples where helpful

3. **Iterate on Suggestions**
   - Treat Copilot suggestions as a starting point
   - Refine and edit generated code as needed
   - Provide additional context if suggestions aren't relevant

### Code Quality

1. **Always Review Generated Code**
   - Verify that suggestions match your requirements
   - Check for security vulnerabilities or bugs
   - Ensure code follows your project's standards

2. **Maintain Consistent Naming**
   - Use underscore_for_field_names in languages that follow snake_case conventions
   - Be consistent with your project's naming style
   - Edit suggestions to match your conventions

3. **Test Generated Code**
   - Don't assume generated code works correctly
   - Write tests for functionality from Copilot
   - Validate edge cases and error handling

### Workflow Integration

1. **Start with Structure**
   - Begin with function signatures or class definitions
   - Let Copilot fill in implementation details
   - Guide the process with comments and partial code

2. **Use for Repetitive Tasks**
   - Leverage Copilot for boilerplate code
   - Generate similar patterns across your codebase
   - Automate routine coding tasks

3. **Pair Programming Approach**
   - Think of Copilot as a pair programming partner
   - Engage in a dialogue through comments
   - Provide feedback by accepting, rejecting, or modifying suggestions

## Prompt Examples for GitHub Copilot

### Function Implementation

```python
# Function to calculate the moving average of a time series
# Parameters:
#   data: List of numerical values
#   window_size: Number of points to include in the moving average
# Returns:
#   List of moving averages with the same length as data
def calculate_moving_average(data, window_size):
    # Your cursor here will trigger Copilot suggestions
```

### API Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * Creates a REST API endpoint to retrieve user information
 * 
 * @param {object} request - The HTTP request object containing:
 *   - params.user_id: The ID of the user to retrieve
 * @returns {object} User data including name, email, and preferences
 * @throws {Error} If user is not found or unauthorized
 */
function get_user_info(request) {
    // Your cursor here will trigger Copilot suggestions
}
```

### Test Generation

```python
# Write tests for the following function:
def validate_email(email_address):
    import re
    pattern = r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$'
    return bool(re.match(pattern, email_address))

# Generate test cases covering valid and invalid emails
import unittest

class TestEmailValidation(unittest.TestCase):
    # Your cursor here will trigger Copilot to generate tests
```

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### Python
1. **Type Hints**
   - Use type hints to improve suggestions
   - Include docstring parameters with types
   - Use dataclasses for structured data

### JavaScript/TypeScript
1. **JSDoc Comments**
   - Provide detailed JSDoc annotations
   - Include parameter and return types
   - Document exceptions and edge cases

### Java
1. **Class Structure**
   - Document class hierarchy clearly
   - Use descriptive method names
   - Include JavaDoc comments

### C#
1. **XML Documentation**
   - Use XML doc comments
   - Include example usage
   - Document exceptions

## VS Code Configuration Tips

### Settings
```json
{
    "github.copilot.enable": {
        "*": true,
        "plaintext": false,
        "markdown": false
    },
    "github.copilot.inlineSuggest.enable": true,
    "github.copilot.advanced": {
        "length": 500,
        "temperature": 0.7
    }
}
```

   - Break down complex tasks
   - Use more specific function names

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce file size
   - Close unused editors
   - Adjust temperature settings

```javascript
/**
 * RESTful API endpoint pattern
 * Include:
 * - HTTP method
 * - Route parameters
 * - Query parameters
 * - Request body structure
 * - Response format
 * - Error handling
 */
```
