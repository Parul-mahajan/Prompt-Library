# Explaining Complex Code Snippets

## Prompt 1: Breaking Down Complex Code
```
Intent: To help developers explain complex code snippets in a clear and understandable way.

Context: You are explaining a complex code snippet to a team member. The code details are as follows:

Code_snippet: {code_snippet}
Programming_language: {programming_language}

Generate an explanation of the code, including:
- Overall purpose of the code.
- Breakdown of complex parts.
- Line-by-line explanation of critical sections.

Example:
Code_snippet:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result
```
Programming_language: "Python"
Explanation:
1. Overall Purpose: This code implements the merge sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity.

2. Key Components:
   - `merge_sort`: The main recursive function that divides the array into halves.
   - `merge`: Helper function that combines two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

3. Line-by-Line Explanation:
   - First, the `merge_sort` function checks if the array has 0 or 1 elements (base case).
   - It then divides the array into two halves and recursively sorts each half.
   - The `merge` function takes the two sorted halves and combines them.
   - The while loop compares elements from both arrays, adding the smaller one to the result.
   - The `extend` methods add any remaining elements from either array.
